# React Debugging with React Router

This project is a hands-on debugging exercise focused on React Router and common React patterns. It contains intentionally placed bugs and issues that developers might encounter in real-world applications.

By the end of this code-along, you will understand how to use the powerful Profiler Feature of the React Development Tools.

This code-along is part of the [Web Development Bootcamp](https://codeverge.de) at Codeverge.
